# dev-toolbox
A small application I use for running scripts and launching utilities that
help in the development and management of things I'm programming.

This is a C# rewrite of my original program, originally written in Visual Basic.
I've been wanting to do a rewrite for quite a while, as I wrote in the readme of
the VB version, for the experience with C# because I enjoy branching out and trying
new languages (though I'm still a little intimidated by some). I will likely be
maintaining this as the primary version from here on and porting additions back
to the VB version.
